<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>WILLIAM BLAKE.</h3>

  <p>My antiquarian tendencies bring me acquainted with many neglected and
  obscure individuals connected with our earlier English literature, who,
  after "fretting their hour" upon life's stage, have passed away; leaving
  their names entombed upon the title-page of some unappreciated or
  crotchetty book, only to be found upon the shelves of the curious.</p>

  <p>To look for these in Kippis, Chalmers, Gorton, or Rose would be a
  waste of time; and although agreeing to some extent with the
  <i>Utilitarians</i>, that we have all that was worth preserving of the
  <i>Antediluvians</i>, there is, I think, here and there a name worth
  resuscitating, possessing claims to a <i>niche</i> in our "Antiquary's
  Newspaper;" and for that distinction, I would now put in a plea on behalf
  of my present subject, William Blake.</p>

  <p>Although our author belongs to the <i>eccentric category</i>, he is a
  character not only deserving of notice, but a model for imitation: the
  "<i>bee</i> in his bonnet" having set his sympathies in the healthy
  direction of a large <i>philanthropy</i> for the spiritual and temporal
  interests of his fellow men.</p>

  <p>The congenial reader has already, I doubt not, anticipated that I am
  about to introduce that nondescript book bearing the running
  title&mdash;and it never had any other&mdash;of <i>Silver Drops, or
  Serious Things;</i> purporting, in a kind of colophon, to be "written by
  William Blake, housekeeper to the Ladies' Charity School."<a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The curious in
  old books knows too, that, apart from its subject, the <i>Silver
  Drops</i> of W.&nbsp;B. has usually an attractive exterior; most of the
  <i>exemplaires</i> which have come under my notice being sumptuously
  bound in old morocco, profusely tooled; with the name of the party to
  whom it had apparently been presented, stamped in a compartment upon the
  cover. Its value is farther enhanced by its pictorial and emblematical
  accompaniments. These are four in number: the first representing a heart,
  whereon <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span>a fanciful picture of Charity supported by
  angels; second, a view of Highgate Charity Schools (Dorchester House);
  third, Time with his scythe and hour-glass<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>; and the fourth, in three
  compartments, the centre containing butterflies; the smaller at top and
  bottom, sententious allusions to the value of time&mdash;"Time drops
  pearles from his golden wings," &amp;c. These are respectable engravings,
  but by whom executed I know not. After these, and before coming to the
  <i>Silver Drops</i>, which are perhaps something akin to Master Brooks'
  <i>Apples of Gold</i>, the book begins abruptly: "The Ladies' Charity
  School-house Roll of Highgate, or a subscription of many noble
  well-disposed ladies for the easie carrying of it on." "Being well
  informed," runs the Prospectus, "that there is a pious, good, commendable
  work for maintaining near forty poor or fatherless children, born all at
  or near Highgate, Hornsey, or Hamsted: we, whose names are subscribed, do
  engage or promise, that if the said boys are decently cloathed in blew,
  lined with yellow; constantly fed all alike with good and wholsom diet;
  taught to read, write, and cast accompts, and so put out to trades, in
  order to live another day; then we will give for one year, two or three
  (if we well like the design, and prudent management of it,) once a year,
  the sum below mentioned," &amp;c. The projector of this good work was the
  subject of my present note; and after thus introducing it, the worthy
  "woollen-draper, at the sign of the Golden Boy, Maiden Lane, Covent
  Garden," for such he was, goes on to recommend and enforce its importance
  in a variety of cajolling addresses, or, as he calls them,
  "charity-school sticks," to the great and wealthy; ostensibly the
  production of the boys, but in reality the concoctions of Mr. Blake, and
  in which he pleads earnestly for his <i>hobby</i>. In <i>An Essay, or
  Humble Guess, how the Noble Ladies may be inclined to give to and
  encourage their Charity-school at Highgate</i>, Mr. Blake farther
  humorously shows up the various dispositions of his fair
  friends:&mdash;"And first," says he, "my lady such-a-one cryed, Come, we
  will make one purse out of our family;" and "my lady such-an-one said she
  would give for the fancy of the Roll and charity stick. My lady
  such-an-one cryed by her troth she would give nothing at all, for she had
  waies enough for her money; while another would give five or six stone of
  beef every week." Again, in trying to come at the great citizen-ladies,
  he magnifies, in the following characteristic style, the city of London;
  and, by implication, their noble husbands and themselves:&mdash;"There
  is," says Mr. Blake, "the Tower and the Monument; the old Change,
  Guild-Hall, and Blackwall-Hall, <i>which some would fain burn again</i>;
  there is Bow steeple, the <i>Holy Bible</i>, <i>the Silver Bells of
  Aaron</i>, <i>the godly-outed ministers</i>; the melodious musick of the
  Gospels; Smithfield martyrs yet alive; and the best society, the very
  best in all the world for civility, loyalty, men, and manners; with the
  greatest cash, bulk, mass, and stock of all sorts of silks, cinnamon,
  spices, wine, gold, pearls, Spanish wooll and cloaths; with the river
  <i>Nilus</i>, and the stately ships of <i>Tarshish</i> to carry in and
  out the great merchandizes of the world." In this the city dames are
  attacked collectively. Individually, he would wheedle them thus into his
  charitable plans:&mdash;"Now pray, dear madam, speak or write to my lady
  out of hand, and tell her how it is with us; and if she will subscribe a
  good <i>gob</i>, and get the young ladies to do so too; and then put in
  altogether with your lordship's and Sir James's also: for it is necessary
  he or you in his stead should do something, <i>now the great ship is come
  safe in, and by giving some of the first-fruits of your great bay, or new
  plantation, to our school, the rest will be blessed the better</i>." The
  scheme seems to have offered attractions to the Highgate
  gentry:&mdash;"The great ladies do allow their house-keeper," he
  continues, "one bottle of wine, three of ale, half a dozen of rolls, and
  two dishes of meat a-day; who is to see the wilderness, orchard, great
  prospects, walks, and gardens, all well kept and rolled for their
  honours' families; and to give them small treats according to discretion
  when they please to take the air, which is undoubtedly the best round
  London." Notwithstanding the eloquent pleadings of Mr. Blake for their
  assistance and support, it is to be feared that the <i>noble ladies</i>
  allowed the predictions of his friends to be verified, and <i>did</i>
  "suffer such an inferiour meane and little person (to use his own
  phraseology) to sink under the burden of so good and great a work:" for
  we find that Gough, in allusion thereto, says (<i>Topographical
  Anecdotes</i>, vol. i. p. 644.):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This Hospital at Highgate, called the Ladies' Charity School, was
  erected by one W. Blake, a woollen-draper in Covent Garden; who having
  purchased Dorchester House, and having fooled away his estate in
  building, was thrown into prison."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Even here, and under such circumstances, our subject was nothing
  daunted; for the same authority informs us, that, still full of his
  philanthropic projects, he took the opportunity his leisure there
  admitted to write another work upon his favourite topic of educating and
  caring for the <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>poor; its title is, <i>The State and Case of
  a Design for the better Education of Thousands of Parish Children
  successively in the vast Northern Suburbs of London vindicated,
  &amp;c.</i> Besides the above, there is another remarkable little piece
  which I have seen, beginning abruptly, "Here followeth a briefe
  exhortation which I gave in my owne house at my wife's funerall to our
  friends then present," by Blake, with the MS. date, 1650; and exhibits
  this original character in another not less amiable light:&mdash;"I was
  brought up," says he, "by my parents to learne <i>Hail Mary</i>,
  paternoster, the Beliefe, and learne to reade; and where I served my
  apprenticeship little more was to be found." He attributes it to God's
  grace that he fell a reading the <i>Practice of Piety</i>, by which means
  he got a little persuading of God's love to his soul:&mdash;"Well, my
  time being out, I set up for myselfe; and seeking out for a wife, which,
  with long waiting and difficulty, much expence and charge, at last I got.
  Four children God gave me by her; but he hath taken them and her all
  again too, who was a woman of a thousand." Mr. B. then naturally indulges
  in a panegyric upon this pattern of wives, and reproaches himself for his
  former insensibility to her surpassing merits: relating with great
  <i>naïveté</i> some domestic passages, with examples of her piety and
  trials, in one of which latter the <i>enemy</i> would tempt her to
  suicide:&mdash;"There lie your garters," said he; "but she threw them
  aside, and so escaped this will of the Devil."</p>

  <p>In conclusion, let me inquire if your Highgate correspondents are
  cognisant of any existing institution raised upon the foundation of
  William Blake's Charity School at Dorchester House?</p>

<h3>A POEM BY SHELLEY, NOT IN HIS WORKS.</h3>

  <p>The following poem was published in a South Carolina newspaper in the
  year 1839. The person who communicates it states that it was among the
  papers of a deceased friend, in a small packet, endorsed "A letter and
  two poems written by Shelley the poet, and lent to me by Mr. Trelawney in
  1823. I was prevented from returning them to him, for which I am sorry,
  since this is the only copy of them&mdash;they have never been
  published." Upon this poem was written, "Given to me by Shelley, who
  composed it as we were sailing one evening together."</p>

<h3>THE IMPOSSIBILITIES OF HISTORY.</h3>

  <p>In <i>The Tablet</i> of June 18 is a leading article on the proposed
  erection of Baron Marochetti's statue of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion.
  Theology and history are mixed: of course I shall carefully exclude the
  former. I have tried to trace the statements to their sources; and where
  I have failed, perhaps some of your readers may be able to help me.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When the physicians told him that they could do nothing more for him,
  and when his confessor had done his duty faithfully and with all honesty,
  the stern old soldier commanded his attendants to take him off the bed,
  and lay him naked on the bare floor. When this was done, he then bade
  them take a discipline and scourge him with all their might. This was the
  last command of their royal master; and in this he was obeyed with more
  zeal than he found displayed when at the head of his troops in
  Palestine."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I find no record that "the stern old soldier," who was then forty-two
  years of age, and whom the writer oddly calls Richard II., had any reason
  to complain of want of zeal in his troops. They fought well, and flogged
  well&mdash;if they flogged at all. Richard died of gangrene in the
  shoulder; and I have the authority of an eminent physician for saying,
  that gangrene, so near the vital parts, would produce such mental and
  bodily prostration, that it is highly improbable that the patient, unless
  in delirium, should give such an order, and impossible that he should
  live through its execution.</p>

  <p>Hume and Lingard do not allude to the "discipline;" and the silence of
  the latter is important. Henry says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Having expressed great penitence for his vices, and having undergone
  a very severe discipline from the hands of the clergy, who attended him
  in his last moments," &amp;c.&mdash;Vol. iii. p. 161. ed. 1777.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He cites Brompton, and there I find the penance given much stronger
  than in <i>The Tablet</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Præcepitque pedes sibi ligari, et in altum suspendi nudumque corpus
  flagellis cædi et lacerari, donec ipse præciperat ut silerent. Cumque diu
  cæderetur, ex præcepto, ad modicum siluerunt. Et spiritu iterum
  reassumpto, hoc idem secundo ac tertio in abundantiâ sanguinis
  compleverunt. Tamdiu in se revertens, afferri viaticum sibi jussit et se
  velut proditorem et hostem, contra dominum suum ligatis pedibus fune
  trahi."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is taken from Brompton's Chronicle in <i>Decem Scriptores
  Historiæ Anglicanæ</i>, 1652, p. 1279., edited by Selden. As Brompton
  lived in the reign of Edward III., he is not a high authority upon any
  matter in that of Richard I. I cannot find any other. Hoveden and
  Knyghton are silent. Is the fact stated elsewhere? Hoveden states, and
  the modern historians follow him, that after the king's death, Marchader
  seized the archer, flayed him alive, and then hanged him. My medical
  authority says, that no man could be flayed <i>alive</i>: and that the
  most skilful operator could not remove the skin of one arm from the elbow
  to the wrist, before the patient would die from the shock to his
  system.</p>

  <p>Mr. Riley, in a note on the passage in Hoveden, cites from the
  <i>Winchester Chronicle</i> a possible account of Gurdum being tortured
  to death. The historian of <i>The Tablet</i>, in the same article,
  says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We are far from attributing absolute perfection to the son of Henry
  II., one of that awful race popularly believed to be descended from the
  devil. When Henry, as a boy, practising Whiggery by revolting against his
  father, was presented to St. Bernard at the Court of the King of France,
  the saint looked at him with a sort of terror, and said, 'From the Devil
  you came, and to the Devil you will go.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The fact that Henry II. rebelled against his father is not given in
  any history which I have <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>read; and the popular belief in the
  remarkable descent of Henry, and consequently of our present royal
  family, is quite new to me, and to all of whom I have inquired. Still,
  finding that the writer had an authority for the "discipline," he may
  have one for the Devil. If so, I should like to know it; for I
  contemplate something after the example of Lucian's <i>Quomodo Historia
  sit conscribenda</i>.</p>

  <p>Its first appearance is in Barnes, who quotes it from Athenagoras
  "sine auctoris nomine." Carmeli includes it with others, to which he
  prefixes the observation,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>There is, then, no positive evidence of this passage having ever been
  attributed, by any competent scholar, to Euripides. Indirect proof that
  it could not have been written by him is thus shown:&mdash;In the

  <p>Now, had Barnes referred to the scholiast on the Antigone, or
  remembered at the time the above-cited passage, he would either not have
  omitted the conclusion of his distich, or he would at once have seen that
  a passage quoted as "<span title="ek tou" class="grk">&#x1F14;&kappa;

  seventeen years the senior of Euripides, could not have been the original

  <p>The words "when he wills it" being left out by Barnes and Carmeli, but
  which correspond with the last line of the quotation from Sophocles. The
  old scholiast introduces the exact quotation referred to by Sophocles as
  "a celebrated (notorious, <span title="aoidimon" class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&omicron;&#x1F77;&delta;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&nu;</span>) and
  splendid saying, revealed by the wisdom of <i>some one</i>, <span

  <p>Indeed, the sentiment must have been as old as Paganism, wherein,
  whilst all <i>voluntary</i> acts are attributed to the individual, all
  <i>involuntary</i> ones are ascribed to the Deity. Even <i>sneezing</i>
  was so considered: hence the phrase common in the lower circles in
  England, "Bless us," and in a higher grade in Germany, "Gott segne euch,"
  which form the usual chorus to a sneeze.</p>

  <p>The other scholiast, Triclinius, explains the passage of Sophocles by
  saying, "The gods lead to error (<span title="blabên" class="grk"
  >&beta;&lambda;&#x1F71;&beta;&eta;&nu;</span>) him whom they intend to
  make miserable (<span title="dustuchein" class="grk"

  hence the application to Antigone, who considers death as sweet."</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>A Passage in "The Taming of the Shrew."</i>&mdash;Perhaps I mistake
  it, but <span class="sc">Mr. C. Mansfield Ingleby</span> seems to me to
  write in a tone as if he fancied I should be unwilling to answer his
  questions, whether public or private. Although I am not personally
  acquainted with him, we have had some correspondence, and I must always
  feel that a man so zealous and intelligent is entitled to the best reply
  I can afford. I can have no hesitation in informing him that, in
  preparing what he terms my "monovolume Shakspeare," I pursued this plan
  throughout; I adopted, as my foundation, the edition in eight volumes
  octavo, which I completed in 1844; that was "formed from an entirely new
  collation of the old editions," and my object there was to give the most
  accurate representation of the text of the folios and quartos. Upon that
  stock I engrafted the manuscript alterations in my folio 1632, in every
  case in which it seemed to me possible that the old corrector might be
  right&mdash;in short, wherever two opinions could be entertained as to
  the reading: in this way my text in the "monovolume Shakspeare" was
  "regulated by the old copies, and by the recently discovered folio of
  1632."</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span> will see that in the brief preface
  to the "monovolume Shakspeare," I expressly say that "while a general
  similarity (to the folio 1632) has been preserved, care has been taken
  <i>to rectify the admitted mistakes of the early impression</i>, and to
  introduce such alterations of a corrupt and imperfect text, as were
  warranted by better authorities. Thus, while the new readings of the old
  corrector of the folio 1632, considerably exceeding a thousand, are duly
  inserted in the places <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>to which they belong, the old readings,
  which, during the last century and a half, have recommended themselves
  for adoption, and have been derived from a comparison of ancient printed
  editions, have also been incorporated." I do not know how I could have
  expressed myself with greater clearness; and it was merely for the sake
  of distinctness that I referred to the result of my own labours in 1842,
  1843, and 1844, during which years my eight volumes octavo were
  proceeding through the press. Those labours, it will be seen, essentially
  contributed to lighten my task in preparing the "monovolume
  Shakspeare."</p>

  <p>My answer respecting the passage in <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>,
  referred to by <span class="sc">Mr. Ingleby</span>, will, I trust, be
  equally satisfactory; it shall be equally plain.</p>

  <p>I inserted <i>ambler</i>, because it is the word substituted in
  manuscript in the margin of my folio 1632. I adopted <i>mercatantè</i>,
  as proposed by Steevens, not only because it is the true Italian word,
  but because it exactly fits the place in the verse, <i>mercatant</i> (the
  word in the folios) being a syllable short of the required number. In the
  very copy of Florio's <i>Italian Dictionary</i>, which I bought of Rodd
  at the time when I purchased my folio 1632, I find <i>mercatantè</i>
  translated by the word "marchant," "marter," and "trader," exactly the
  sense required. Then, as to "surely" instead of <i>surly</i>, I venture
  to think that "surely" is the true reading:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In gait and countenance surely like a father."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>"Surely like a father" is certainly like a father; and although a man
  may be <i>surly</i> in his "countenance," I do not well see how he could
  be <i>surly</i> in his "gait;" besides, what had occurred to make the
  pedant <i>surly</i>? This appears to me the best reason for rejecting
  <i>surly</i> in favour of "surely;" but I have another, which can hardly
  be refused to an editor who professes to follow the old copies, where
  they are not contradicted. I allude to the folio 1628, where the line
  stands precisely thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In gate and countenance surely like a Father."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The folio 1632 misprinted "surely" <i>surly</i>, as, in <i>Julius
  Cæsar</i>, Act I. Sc. 3., it committed the opposite blunder, by
  misprinting "surly" <i>surely</i>. Another piece of evidence, to prove
  that "surely" was the poet's word in <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>, has
  comparatively recently fallen in my way; I did not know of its existence
  in 1844, or it would have been of considerable use to me. It is a
  <i>unique</i> quarto of the play, which came out some years before the
  folio 1623, and is not to be confounded with the quarto of <i>The Taming
  of the Shrew</i>, with the date of 1631 on the title-page. This new
  authority has the line exactly as it is given in the folio 1623, which,
  in truth, was printed from it. It is now before me.</p>

  <p><i>Critical Digest of various Readings in the Works of
  Shakspeare.</i>&mdash;There is much activity in the literary world just
  now about the text of Shakspeare: but one most essential work, in
  reference to that text, still remains to be performed,&mdash;I mean, the
  publication of a complete digest of <i>all</i> the various readings, in a
  concise shape, such as those which we possess in relation to the MSS. and
  other editions of nearly every classical author.</p>

  <p>At present, all editions of Shakspeare which claim to be considered
  critical, contain much loose information on readings, mixed up with notes
  (frequently very diffuse) on miscellaneous topics. This is not in the
  least what we require: we need a regular <i>digest</i> of readings,
  wholly distinct from long debates about their value.</p>

  <p>What I mean will be plain to any one who is familiar with any good
  critical edition of the Greek New Testament, or with such books as
  Gaisford's <i>Herodotus</i>, the Berlin <i>Aristotle</i>, the Zurich
  <i>Plato</i>, and the like. We ought to have, first, a good text of
  Shakspeare: such as may represent, as fairly as possible, the real
  results of the labours of the soundest critics; and, secondly, page by
  page, at the foot of that text, the following particulars:</p>

  <p>I. All the readings of the folios, which should be cited as A, B, C,
  and D.</p>

  <p>II. All the readings of the quartos, which might be cited separately
  in each play that possesses them, either as a, b, c, d; or as 1, 2, 3,
  and 4.</p>

  <p>III. A succinct summary of all the respectable criticisms, in the way
  of conjecture, on the text. This is especially needed. The recent volumes
  of Messrs. Collier, Singer, and Dyce, show that even editors of
  Shakspeare scarcely know the history of all the emendations. Let their
  precise <i>pedigree</i> be in the last case recorded with the most
  absolute brevity; simply the <i>suggestion</i>, and the names of its
  proposers and adopters.</p>

  <p>IV. To simplify this last point, a new siglation might be introduced
  to denote the various critical editions.</p>

  <p>Such a publication should be kept distinct from any commentary;
  especially from one laid out in the broad flat style of modern editors.
  Mr. Collier's volume of <i>Emendations</i>, &amp;c., for instance, need
  not have occupied half its present space, if he had first denoted his MS.
  corrector by some short symbol, instead of by a lengthy phrase; and,
  secondly, introduced his suggestions by some such formularies as those
  employed in classical criticisms, instead of toiling laboriously after
  variations in his style of expression, till we are wearied by the real
  iteration which lies under the seeming diversity.</p>

  <p>There should be none of this <i>phrasework</i> in the digest which I
  recommend. If indeed it were found absolutely necessary to connect it
  with a commentary, then arrange the two portions of the <!-- Page 75
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span>apparatus as in
  Arnold's edition of <i>Thucydides</i>: the <i>variæ lectiones</i> in the
  middle of the page, and the comment in a different type below it. But I
  repeat, it would be better still to give us the digest <i>without</i> the
  comment. All would go into one large volume. And it cannot be doubted
  that such a volume, if thoroughly well done, would furnish at once a sort
  of <i>textus receptus</i>, and a critical basis, from which future
  editors might commence their labours. It would also be an indispensable
  book of reference to all who treat of, or are interested in, the poet's
  text. Such, I say, would be its certain prospects if the editor were at
  once an accurate, painstaking scholar, and a man of true poetical
  feeling. The labour would be great, but so would be the reward. It is
  only what the ablest scholars have proudly undertaken for the classics,
  even in the face of toils far more severe. Would that Mr. Dyce could be
  roused to attempt it!</p>

  <p class="author">B.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Some such edition as that alluded to by our correspondent has been
  long desired and contemplated. A proposal in connexion with it has been
  afloat for some time past, and we had hoped would have been publicly made
  in our pages before now. There are difficulties in the way which do not
  exist in the parallel instances from classical literature, and which do
  not seem to have occurred to our correspondent; but the project is in
  good hands, and we hope will soon be brought to bear.&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Ed.</span>]</p>

</div>

  <p><i>Emendations of Shakspeare.</i>&mdash;I am sadly afraid, what with
  one annotator and another, that we, in a very little time, shall have
  Shakspeare so modernised and weeded of his peculiarities, that he will
  become a very second-rate sort of a person indeed; for I now see with no
  little alarm, that one of his most delightful quaintnesses is to give way
  to the march of refinement, and be altogether ruined. Hazlitt, one the
  most original and talented of critics, has somewhere said, that there was
  not in any passage of Shakspeare any single word that could be changed to
  one more appropriate, and as an instance he gives a passage from
  <i>Macbeth</i>, which certainly is one of the most perfect and beautiful
  to be found in the whole of his works:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air</p>
      <p>Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself</p>
      <p>Unto our gentle senses.</p>
      <p class="i10">This guest of summer,</p>
      <p>The temple-haunting martlet, does approve</p>
      <p>By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath</p>
      <p>Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze, buttress,</p>
      <p>Nor coin of vantage, but this bird hath made</p>
      <p>His pendent bed, and procreant cradle: where they</p>
      <p>Most breed and haunt, I have observed, the air</p>
      <p>Is delicate."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There are some who differ from Hazlitt in the present day, and assert
  that there is an error in the press in Dogberry's reproof of Borachio for
  calling him an "ass." The passage as it stands is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I am a wise fellow; and which is more, an officer, and which is more,
  a <i>householder</i>, and which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as
  any is in Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a rich fellow
  enough, go to; and a fellow that hath had <i>losses</i>, and one that
  hath two gowns, and everything handsome about him."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>His having had losses evidently meaning, though he was then poor, that
  his circumstances were at one time so prosperous, that he could afford to
  <i>bear</i> losses; and he, even then, had a superfluity of wardrobe in
  "two gowns, and everything handsome about him." But this little word
  <i>losses</i>, the perfect Shakspearian quaintness of which is
  universally acknowledged, is to be changed into <i>leases</i>; if it
  should be <i>leases</i>, how is it that it does not follow upon
  "householder," instead of being introduced so many words after? as, if
  <i>leases</i> were the proper word, it would assuredly have suggested
  itself immediately as an additional item to his respectability as a
  householder: for a moment only fancy similar corrections to be introduced
  in others of Shakspeare's plays, and Falstaff be made to exclaim at the
  robbery at Gad's Hill, "Down with them, they dislike us old men," instead
  of "they hate us youth;" for Falstaff was no boy at the time, and this
  might be advanced as an authority for the emendation. But seriously, if
  this alteration is sent forth as a specimen of the improvements about to
  be effected in Shakspeare, from an edition of his plays lately
  discovered, I shall, for one, deeply regret that it was ever rescued
  front its oblivion; for with my prejudices and prepossessions against
  interpolations, and in favour of old readings, I shall find it no easy
  matter to reconcile my mind to the new. Strip history of its romance, and
  you deprive it of its principal charm; the scenery of a play-house
  imposes upon us an illusion, and though we know it to be so, it is not
  essential that the impression should be removed. I remember once
  travelling at night in Norfolk, and a part of my way was through a wood,
  at the end of which I came upon a lake lit up by a magnificent moon. I
  subsequently went the same road by day: the wood, I then found, was a
  mere belt of trees, and the lake had dwindled to a duck-pond. I have ever
  since wished that the first impression had remained unchanged; but this
  is a digression. There is no author so universal as Shakspeare, and would
  that be the case if he was not thoroughly understood? He is appreciated
  alike in the closet and on the stage, quoted by saints and sages, in the
  pulpit and the senate, and your nostrum-monger advertises his wares with
  a quotation from his pages; does he then require interpreting who is his
  own interpreter? Johnson says of him that&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Panting Time toil'd after him in vain."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span></p>

  <p>And that he&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Exhausted worlds and then imagined new."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There is no passion that he has not pourtrayed, and laid bare in its
  beauty or deformity; no feeling or affection to which his genius has not
  given the stamp of immortality: and does he want an interpreter? It is
  treading on dangerous ground to attempt to improve him. Even <span
  class="sc">Mr. Knight</span>, enthusiast as he is in his veneration for
  Shakspeare, and who, by his noble editions of the poet's works, has won
  the admiration and secured the gratitude of every lover of the poet, has
  gone too far in his emendations when he changes a line in <i>Romeo and
  Juliet</i> from</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>to</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>As in the latter case the line will not scan unless the word "friar"
  be reduced to a monosyllable, which, on reflection, I think <span
  class="sc">Mr. Knight</span> will be inclined to admit. But my paper is,
  I fear, extending to a limit beyond which you have occasionally warned
  your correspondents not to go, and I must therefore draw my remarks to a
  close, with a hope that not any offence will be taken where none is
  intended by those to whom any of my observations may apply.</p>

<h3>"THE DANCE OF DEATH."</h3>

  <p>Amongst the numerous emblematic works, it has often appeared to me
  that the above work should be republished entire; to give any part of it
  would be spoiling a most admirable series. I should desire to see it
  executed not as a fac-simile, but improved by good modern artists. The
  history of "The Dance of Death" is too long and too obscure to enter upon
  here; but from the general tenor of the accounts and criticisms of the
  work, it does not appear to have originated at all with Hans Holbein, or
  even his father, who also really painted it at Basil, in Switzerland, but
  to have had its origin in more remote times, as quoted in several
  authors, that anciently monasteries usually had a painted representation
  of a Death's Dance upon the walls. It is a subject, therefore, open to
  any artist, nor could it be said he had pirated anything if he treated
  the subject after his own fashion. "The Dance of Death" begins of course
  with king, the queen, the bishop, the lawyer, the lovers, &amp;c., and
  ends with the child, whom Death is leading away from the weeping mother.
  The original plates of Hollar, from Holbein's drawings, are possibly
  still extant, but they are by no means perfect, although admirable in
  expression. The deaths or skeletons are very ill-drawn as to the
  anatomical structure, and were they better the work would be excellent.
  The Death lugging off the fat abbot is inimitable; and the gallant way he
  escorts the lady abbess out the convent door is very good. I have the
  engravings by Hollar, and have made some of the designs afresh, intending
  to lithograph them at some future day; but there being thirty subjects in
  all, the work would be a difficult task. Mr. J.&nbsp;B. Yates might, indeed,
  with his excellent collection of Emblemata, revive this old and beautiful
  taste now in abeyance: it is now rarely practised by our painters. There
  is, however, a very fine picture in the Royal Academy Exhibition, by Mr.
  Goodall, which is, strictly speaking, an emblem, though the artist calls
  it an historical episode. Now it appears to me an episode cannot be
  reduced into a representation; it might embrace a complete picture in
  writing, but as I read the picture it is an emblem, and would have been
  still more perfect had the painter treated it accordingly. The old man at
  the helm of the barge might well represent Strafford, because, though he
  holds the tiller, he is not engaged in steering right, his eyes are not
  directed to his port. Charles himself, rightly enough, has his back to
  the port, and is truly not engaged in manly affairs, nor attending to his
  duty; but the sentiment of frivolity here painted cannot, I should say,
  attach itself to him, for he is not to be reproached with idling away his
  time with women and children, as this more strictly must be laid to his
  son. But the port where some grim-looking men are seriously waiting for
  him, completes a very happy and poetical idea, but incomplete as an
  emblem, which it really is; and were the emblematic rules more
  cultivated, it would have told its story much better.</p>

  <p>At present, the taste of the day lies in more direct caricature, and
  our volatile friend <i>Punch</i> does the needful in his wicked sallies
  of wit, and his fertile pencil. His sharp rubs are perhaps more effective
  to John Bull's temper, who can take a blow with Punch's truncheon and
  bear no malice after it,&mdash;the heavy lectures of the ancients are not
  so well suited to his constitution.</p>

<h3>FRAGMENTS OF MSS.</h3>

  <p>Dr. Maitland, in his valuable volume on the "Dark Ages," has the
  following remarks on a subject which I think has not met with the
  attention it deserves:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Those who are in the habit of looking at such things, know how
  commonly early printed books, whose binding has undergone the analytical
  operation of damp, or mere old age, disclose the under end pieces of
  beautiful and ancient manuscript. They know how freely parchment was used
  for backs and bands, and fly-leaves, and even for covers. The thing is so
  common, that those who are accustomed to see old books <i>have ceased to
  notice it</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In order to come within the design of your pages, I must put this in
  the shape of a Query, and ask, if it is not a pity that this fact has
  <i>ceased to be noticed</i>? We do not know what treasures may be
  contained in the shabby covers which we contemplate getting rid of.
  "There are thousands" (of MSS.), says the same writer, "equally
  destroyed,&mdash;thousands of murdered wretches not so completely
  annihilated: their ghosts do walk the earth; they glide unseen into our
  libraries, our studies, our very hands; they are all about and around us.
  We even take them up and lay them down, without knowing of their
  existence; unless time and damp (as if to punish and mock us for robbing
  them of their prey) have loosed their bonds, and set them to confront
  us."</p>

  <p>Archbishop Tenison had not "ceased to notice it." He very diligently
  rescued these "fragments" from the hands of his bookbinder and it is to
  be regretted that he did not take equal precaution in preserving them.
  Recently, all that I could collect have been cleaned, inlaid, and
  arranged chronologically, making two interesting and valuable
  volumes.</p>

  <p>How far would it be desirable to unite for the purpose of collecting
  MS. fragments, and early printed leaves?</p>

  <p>Might not a Society, which should have for its especial object the
  <i>discovery</i>, cataloguing, and circulating information about these
  stray bits, be of great service? <i>E. g.</i> I have before me five
  volumes of Justinian's <i>Codices</i> and <i>Digesta</i>, Paris, 1526;
  the covers of which are made of MS. Thirteen leaves go to make one board.
  They are written on both sides and thus an easy multiplication gives us
  260 pages of MS., or early printing, in the covers of one work!</p>

  <p>It is not unlikely that, if the results of research in this direction
  were carefully registered, many perfect pieces might be recovered.</p>

<h3>THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.</h3>

  <p>I have just met with a passage in the <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i> of
  Sir Thomas Browne, wherein this invention is foreshadowed in terms more
  remarkable and significant, if less imaginative and beautiful, than that
  from <i>The Spectator</i>, to which public attention has already been
  directed, and which, I conceive, must unquestionably have been written,
  with this particular example of the "received tenets and commonly
  presumed truths" of the learned physician's day, distinctly present to
  the mind of Addison. The passage referred to is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is another conceit of better notice, and <i>whispered thorow
  the world</i> with some attention; credulous and vulgar auditors readily
  believing it, and more judicious and distinctive heads not altogether
  rejecting it. The conceit is excellent, and, if the effect would follow,
  somewhat divine: whereby we might communicate like spirits, and confer on
  earth with Menippus in the moon. And this is pretended from the sympathy
  of two needles touched with the same loadstone, and placed in the centre
  of two abecedary circles, or rings with letters described round about
  them, one friend keeping one, and another the other, and agreeing upon
  the hour wherein they will communicate. For then, <i>saith tradition</i>,
  at what distance of place soever, when one needle shall be removed unto
  any letter, the other, by a wonderful sympathy, will move unto the
  same."&mdash;Book <span class="scac">II.</span> chap. ii, 4to., 1669, p.
  77.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thus it is that "coming events cast their shadows before:" and, in the
  present case, one is curious to learn how far back the <i>shadow</i> may
  be traced. By whom has this <i>conceit</i> been <i>whispered thorow the
  world</i>? and in what musty tomes is that <i>tradition</i> concealed,
  which speaks concerning it? Kircher's <i>Catena Magnetica</i> might haply
  tell us something in reply to these inquiries.</p>

  <p>In conformity with an often repeated suggestion to the correspondents
  of "N. &amp; Q.," to the simple signature of my <i>habitat</i>, alone
  hitherto adopted by me, I now subjoin my name.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Sir Walter Raleigh.</i>&mdash;In the discussions on the copyright
  question some years ago, Sir Walter Raleigh was mentioned as one of the
  authors whose posterity is totally extinct; but in his Life, as given in
  <i>Lodge's Portraits</i>, his descendants are given as far down as his
  great-grandchildren, of whom many were still living in 1699, at which
  period, says Mr. Lodge, my information ceases. It seems unlikely that a
  family then so numerous should have utterly perished since, both in its
  male and female branches; and perhaps some of your correspondents may be
  able to trace their subsequent history: the <i>name</i> is certainly not
  extinct, whether its bearers be his descendants or not.</p>

  Walter's half-brothers?</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Which, in Miller's History of that town (p. 40.), is thus
  translated:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We command ye, cause the town of Doncaster to be inclosed with
  <i>hertstone</i> and <i>pale</i>, according as the ditch that is made
  doth require; and that ye make a light <i>brecost</i> or barbican upon
  the bridge, to defend the town."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I shall be obliged by being informed if <i>hertstone</i> is the
  correct translation of the word "herit<span class="over">o</span>ne,"
  and, if so, what species of fortification it was. <i>Pale</i> is probably
  a defence composed of high wooden stakes. <i>Brecost</i> is questionable,
  I imagine, and should most likely be spelt <i>bretesk</i> or
  <i>bretex</i>. I shall be glad, however, of explanations of the
  words.</p>

  <p><i>Roman Catholics confined in Fens of Ely.</i>&mdash;Mr. Dickens, in

  <p>Mr. Dickens had, of course, as he supposed, good authority for making

  1808, by H.&nbsp;I. and D.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;D.: "The Church consists of a nave and chancel,
  both under one roof, which is covered with thatch. The chancel is 30 ft.
  3 in. long, and 15 ft. 5 in. wide. The communion-table is neither raised
  nor inclosed. The floor of the whole church is also of the same height.
  The nave is 30 ft. long, and 16 ft. 1 in. wide. Between the chancel and
  nave are the remains of a screen, and over it the arms of George II.,
  between two tables containing the Lord's Prayer, &amp;c. In the N.&nbsp;E.
  angle is the pulpit, which is of oak, hexagon, ordinary, as are also the
  pews and seats. At the W. end stands the font, which is octagon, the
  faces containing roses and lions, and two figures holding blank
  escutcheons, the pedestal supported by four lions. The steeple is in the
  usual place, small, square, of flints, but little higher than the roof.
  In it is only one bell, inscribed 1759. The entrance into the church on
  the N. side is through a circular Saxon arch, not much ornamented. On the
  side is another of the same description, but more ornamented, with
  zig-zag moulding, &amp;c." Then follow the inscriptions, &amp;c. in the

  <p>[This statute legally abolished the ancient code of the Irish, called

  40th Edward III., under the government of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, Lord
  Lieutenant of Ireland. By this act, the English are commanded in all
  controversies to govern themselves by the common laws of England, so that
  whoever submitted himself to the Brehon law, or the law of the Marches,
  is declared a traitor. Among other things the statute enacted that "the
  alliaunce of the English by marriage with any Irish, the nurture of
  infantes, and gossipred with the Irish, be deemed high treason." And
  again, "If anie man of English race use an Irish name, Irish apparell, or
  any other guize or fashion of the Irish, his lands shall be seized, and
  his bodie imprisoned, till he shall conform to English modes and
  customs." This statute was followed by the 18th Henry VI. c. i. ii. iii.,
  and the 28th Hen. VI., c. i., with similar prohibitions and penalties.
  These prohibitions, however, had little effect; nor were the English laws
  universally submitted to throughout Ireland until the time of James I.,

  <p>I take this opportunity of forwarding to you a curious memorandum
  which I found in rummaging the papers of a "note-maker" of the last
  century. It appears to be a bill of fare for the entertainment of a
  party, upon the "flitch of bacon" being decreed to a happy couple. It is
  at Harrowgate, and not at Dunmow, which would lead us to believe that
  this custom was not confined to one county. The feast itself is almost as
  remarkable, as regards its component parts, as that produced by Mr.
  Thackeray, in his delightful "Lectures," as characteristic of polite
  feeding in Queen Anne's reign:</p>

<h3>ON THE USE OF THE HOUR-GLASS IN PULPITS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 489.)</p>

  <p>Perhaps the following may be of service as a farther illustration of
  this subject.</p>

  <p>Zacharie Boyd says, in <i>The Last Battell of the Sovle in Death</i>,
  1629, reprinted Glasgow, 1831, at p. 469.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Now after his Battell ended hee hath surrendered the spirit,
  <i>Clepsydra effluxit</i>, his <i>houre-glasse</i> is now runne out, and
  his soule is come to its wished home, where it is free from the fetters
  of flesh."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This divine was minister of the barony parish of Glasgow, the church
  for which was then in the crypt of the cathedral. I have no doubt the
  hour-glass was there used from which he draws his simile. Your
  correspondent refers to sermons an hour long, but, to judge from the
  contents of "Mr. Zacharie's" MS. sermons still preserved in the library
  of the College of Glasgow, each, at the rate of ordinary speaking, must
  have occupied at least an hour and a half in delivery. When he had become
  infirm and near his end, and had found it necessary to shorten his
  sermons, his "kirk session" was offended, as&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Feb. 13, 1651. Some are to speak to Mr. Z. Boyd about the soon
  skailing (dismissing) of the Baronie Kirk on Sunday afternoon."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Though sermons are now generally restricted from three quarters to an
  hour's delivery, the practice of long preaching in the olden times in the
  west of Scotland had much prevailed. Within my own recollection I have
  heard sermons of nearly two hours' duration; and early among a few
  classes of the first Dissenters, on "Sacramental Occasions" as they are
  yet called, the services lasted altogether (not unfrequently)
  continuously from ten o'clock on Sabbath forenoon, to three and <!-- Page
  83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span>four o'clock
  the following morning. A traditional anecdote is current of an old
  Presbyterian clergyman, unusually full of matter, who, having preached
  out his hour-glass, was accustomed to pause, and addressing the
  precentor, "<i>Another glass and then</i>," recommenced his sermon.</p>

  <p>A pictorial representation of the hour-glass in a country church is to
  be seen in front of the precentor's desk, or pulpit, in a very scarce
  humorsome print, entitled "Presbyterian Penance," by the famous David
  Allan. It also figures in the engraving of the painting by Wilkie, of
  John Knox preaching before Mary Queen of Scots. About twenty years ago it
  was either in the Cathedral of Stirling or the Armory of the Castle (the
  ancient chapel), that I saw the hour-glass (about twelve inches high)
  which had been connected with one or other of the pulpits, from both of
  which John Knox is said to have preached. It is likely the hour-glass is
  there "even unto this day" (unless abstracted by some relic hunter); and
  if it could be depended on as an original appendage to the pulpits, would
  prove that its use was coeval with the times of the Scottish Reformation.
  I think its high antiquity as certain as the oaken pulpits
  themselves.</p>

  <p>At an early period the general poverty of the country, and the
  scarcity of clocks and watches, must have given rise to the adoption of
  the hour sand-glass, a simple instrument, but yet elegant and impressive,
  for the measurement of a brief portion of our fleeting span.</p>

  <p class="author">G. N.</p>

  <p class="address">Glasgow.</p>

  <p>On the 31st May, 1640, the churchwardens of great Staughton, co.
  Huntingdonshire, "are, and stand charged with (among other church goods),
  a pulpit standinge in the church, having a cover over the same, and an
  houre-glasse adjoininge."</p>

  <p>Copy of a cutting from a magazine, name and date unknown:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Among Dr. Rawlinson's manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, No. 941
  contains collection of <i>Miscellaneous Discourses</i>, by Mr. Lewis of
  Margate, in Kent, whence the following extract has been made:</p>

  <p>"'It appears that these hour-glasses were coeval with our Reformation.
  In a fine frontispiece, prefixed to the Holy Bible of the bishops'
  translation, printed in 4to. by John Day, 1569, Archbishop Parker is
  represented in the pulpit with an hour-glass standing on his right hand;
  ours, here, stood on the left without any frame. It was proper that some
  time should be prescribed for the length of the sermon, and clocks and
  watches were not then so common as they are now. This time of an hour
  continued till the Revolution, as appears by Bishop Sanderson's,
  Tillotson's, Stillingfleet's, Dr. Barrow's, and others' sermons, printed
  during that time.'</p>

  <p>"The writer of this article was informed in 1811 by the Rev. Mr.
  Burder, who had the curacy of St. Dunstan's, Fleet Street, that the large
  silver hour-glass formerly used in that church, was melted down into two
  staff heads for the parish beadles.</p>

  <p>"An hour-glass frame of iron, fixed in the wall by the side of the
  pulpit, was remaining in 1797 in the church of North Moor, in
  Oxfordshire."</p>

  <p>In many of our old pulpits built during the seventeenth century, when
  hour sermons were the rule, and thirty minutes the exception, the shelf
  on which the glass used to stand may still be seen. If I recollect
  rightly, that of Miles Coverdale was thus furnished, as stated in the
  newspapers, at the time the church of Bartholomew was removed. Perhaps
  this emblem was adopted on gravestones as significant of the character of
  Death as a minister or preacher.</p>

  <p>The late Basil Montague, when delivering a course of lectures on
  "Laughter" at the Islington Institution some few years since, kept time
  by the aid of this antique instrument. If I remember aright, he turned
  the glass and said, "<i>Another glass and then</i>," or some equivalent
  expression.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">E. G. Ballard.</span></p>

  <p>There is an example at the church of St. Alban, Wood Street,
  Cheapside. This church was rebuilt by Sir C. Wren, and finished 1685;
  showing that the hour-glass was in use subsequent to the times alluded
  to.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. D. Allcroft.</span></p>

  <p>I saw on 13th January last, an iron hour-glass stand affixed to a
  pillar in the north aisle of Belton Church, in the Isle of Axholme.</p>

<h3>LADIES' ARMS BORNE IN A LOZENGE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 571.)</p>

  <p>The subject of the Query put by your correspondent is one that has
  frequently occurred to me, but which is involved in obscurity. Heraldic
  writers generally have contented themselves with the mere statement of
  ladies' arms being thus borne; and where we do find an opinion hazarded,
  it is more in the form of a quotation from a nameless author, or of a
  timid suggestion, than an attempt to elucidate the question by argument
  or from history.</p>

  <p>By some this form of shield is said to have descended to us from the
  Amazons, who bore such: others say, from the form of their tombstones!
  Now we find it to represent the ancient spindle so much used by ladies;
  and again to be a shield found by the Romans unfit for use, and therefore
  transferred to the weaker sex, who were "allowed to place their ensigns
  upon it, with one corner always uppermost." <!-- Page 84 --><span

  <p>Here are quotations from a few of our writers on the science of
  Heraldry:&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Burke</span>, <i>Encyclop. Herald.</i> 1844. Queen
  Victoria bears her arms on a full and complete shield; "for," says the
  old rhyme&mdash;</p>

      <p>Hence those that England's sceptre wield,</p>

  <p>This, unfortunately, is only one side of the question: and, though
  satisfactorily accounting for the shape of the shield of royalty, does
  not enlighten us on the "origin and meaning" of the lozenge.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><span class="sc">Boyes</span>, <i>Great Theatre of Honour</i>, 1754.
  In this great work the various forms of shields, and the etymology of
  their names, are treated on at considerable length. The Greeks had
  five:&mdash;the <i>Aspis</i>, the <i>Gerron</i> or <i>Gerra</i>, the
  <i>Thurios</i>, the <i>Laiveon</i>, and the <i>Pelte</i> or <i>Pelta</i>.
  The Romans had the <i>Ancile</i>, the <i>Scutum</i>, the <i>Clypeus</i>,
  the <i>Parma</i>, the <i>Cetra</i>, and others; but none of these
  approached the shape of the lozenge. The shields of modern nations are
  also dealt with at length; still the author appears to have had no
  information nor an opinion upon the lozenge, which he dismisses with
  these remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"L'écu des filles est <i>en lozenge</i>, de même de celui des veuves;

</blockquote>

  <p><span class="sc">Coates</span>, <i>Dictionary of Heraldry</i>, 1725,

  <p>None of these authors have touched on the subject; which, considering
  that at the least two of them are the greatest authorities, appears
  somewhat strange.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ferne</span>, <i>Blazon of Gentrie</i>,
  1586&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Thinks the lozenge is formed of the shield called <i>Tessera</i> or
  <i>Tessela</i>, which the Romans, finding unfit for use, did allow to
  women to place their ensigns upon, with one of its angles always
  upmost."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Though unable at this moment to furnish examples in proof of my
  opinion, I must say that it is contrary to the one expressed by your
  correspondent <span class="sc">Ceyrep</span>, that "formerly all ladies
  of rank" bore their arms upon a complete shield, or bore shields upon
  their seals. The two instances cited by him are rather unfortunate, the
  connexion of both ladies with royalty being sufficiently close to suggest
  the possibility of their right to the "full and complete" shield.</p>

  <p>Margaret, Duchess (not Countess) of Norfolk, was sole heir of her
  father, Thomas of Brotherton, fifth Earl of Norfolk, son of King Edward
  I., and Marshal of England. She, "for the greatness of her birth, her
  large revenues and wealth," was created Duchess of Norfolk for life; and
  at the coronation of King Richard II. she exhibited her petition "to be
  accepted to the office of High Marshal," which was, I believe, granted.
  In such case, setting aside her royal descent, I apprehend that, by
  virtue of her office, she would not bear her arms in a lozenge. She bore
  the arms of England with only a label for difference.</p>

  <p>Margaret, Countess of Richmond, was herself royally descended, being
  great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt, son of Edward III.; was
  daughter-in-law of Henry V.'s widow, and mother of Henry VII. Being
  descended from the antenuptial children of John of Gaunt's third wife,
  who had been legitimatised by act of parliament for all purposes except
  succession to the crown, <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page85"></a>{85}</span>Henry VII. would probably desire by every
  means in his power to suppress anything suggestive of his unsubstantial
  title to the crown. It might be by his particular desire that his mother
  assumed the full regal shield, on which to emblazon arms differing but
  slightly from those of her son, the king.</p>

  <p>It is not, however, my opinion that the form of shield under
  consideration is anything like so ancient as some of the authors would
  make it. I do not believe it comes to us either from the Amazons or the
  Romans.</p>

  <p>My own opinion, in the absence of any from the great writers to guide
  me, is, that we owe the use of this form of shield amongst ladies to
  <i>hatchments</i> or <i>funeral achievements</i>. During the time of
  mourning for persons of rank, their coats of arms are set up in churches
  and over the principal entrances of their houses. On these occasions it
  is well known their arms are always placed in a large black lozenge; a
  form adopted as the most proper figure for admitting the coats of arms of
  sixteen ancestors to be placed round it, four on each of the sides of the
  square.</p>

  <p>It was not until the reign of Richard III. that the College of Arms
  was regularly incorporated; and though the science of heraldry received
  its highest polish during the splendid reigns of Edward III. and Henry
  V., it had yet scarcely been subjected to those rules which since the
  establishment of the College have controlled it. Mark Noble, in his
  <i>History of the College of Arms</i>, says that the latter
  reign&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If it did not add to the wealth of the nation at large, gave rise to
  a number of great families, enriched by the spoils of Azincourt, the
  plunder of France, and the ransom of princes. The heraldic body was
  peculiarly prized and protected by the king, who, however, was very
  whimsical in the adoption of cognizances and devices."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>During the greater portion of the fourteenth century, and the early
  part of the fifteenth, there was a rage for jousts, tilts, and
  tournaments; and almost every English nobleman had his officers of arms;
  dukes, marquesses, and earls were allowed a herald and pursuivant; the
  lower nobility, and even knights, might retain one of the latter. To
  these officers belonged the ordering of everything relating to the solemn
  and magnificent funerals, which were so general in these centuries, and
  which they presided over and marshalled.</p>

  <p>During the reign of Edward IV. the exact form of these obsequies was
  prescribed. Not only were the noblemen's own heralds there, but the
  king's also; and not in tabards bearing the sovereign's, but the
  deceased's arms.</p>

  <p>So preposterously fond of funeral rites were monarchs and their
  subjects, that the obsequies of princes were observed by such sovereigns
  as were in alliance with them, and in the same state as if the royal
  remains had been conveyed from one Christian kingdom to another.
  Individuals had their obsequies kept in various places where they had
  particular connexions.<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Is it too much then to presume that in the midst of all this pomp and
  affectation of grief, the hatchment of the deceased nobleman would be
  displayed as much, and continued as long, as possible by the widow? May
  we not reasonably believe that these ladies would vie with each other in
  these displays of the insignia of mourning, until, by usage, the
  lozenge-shaped hatchment became the shield appropriated to the sex?</p>

  <p>These hypotheses are not without some foundation; but if any of your
  correspondents will enunciate another theory, I shall be glad to give it
  my support if it is found to be more reasonable than the foregoing.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Multiplication of Photographs.</i>&mdash;In Vol. viii., p. 60. is a
  letter from <span class="sc">Mr. John Stewart</span> of Pau suggesting
  certain modes of operating in producing positive photographs, and which
  suggestions are apparently offered as <i>novelties</i>, when, in fact,
  they have been for some considerable time in practice by other
  manipulators. Of course, I do not suppose that they are otherwise
  regarded by <span class="sc">Mr. Stewart</span> than as novelties, who
  cannot be acquainted with what is doing here; but it appears to me
  desirable to discriminate between facts that are <i>absolutely</i>, and
  those that are <i>relatively</i> new.</p>

  <p>Most of the transparent stereoscopic photographs sold in such numbers
  by all our eminent opticians, <i>are actually produced</i> in the way
  recommended by <span class="sc">Mr. Stewart</span>; and reduced copies of
  photographs, &amp;c., have been produced in almost every possible variety
  by <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>, and many others of our most
  eminent photographers. Very early in the history of this science, the
  idea was suggested by Mr. Fox Talbot himself, of taking views of a small
  size, and enlarging them for multiplication; and, if I am rightly
  informed, Mr. Ross was applied to to construct a lens specially for the
  purpose. Some months back, as early at least as March or April in the
  present year, Mr. F.&nbsp;H. Wenham actually printed on common chloride paper
  a <i>life-size</i> positive from a small negative on collodion; and
  immediately afterwards adopted the use of iodized paper for the same
  purpose; and after he had exhibited the proofs, I myself repeated the
  experiment. In fact, had there been time at the last meeting of the
  Photographic Society, a paper on this very subject would have been read
  by Mr. Wenham; but the <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>{86}</span>business before the meeting was too
  extensive to admit of it. My object is not, of course, to offer any
  objection to the proposition, but simply to put in a claim of merit for
  the idea originally due to Mr. Fox Talbot, and secondarily to Mr. Wenham,
  who I believe was an earlier operator in this way than any one.</p>

  <p><i>Yellow Bottles for Photographic Chemicals.</i>&mdash;As light

  plain white glass with black paper, as I see directed in some cases?</p>

  <p><i>Abigail</i> (Vol. iv., p. 424.; Vol. v., pp. 38. 94. 450., Vol.
  viii., p. 42.).&mdash;Not having my "N. &amp; Q." at hand, I cannot say
  what may have been already told on this subject, but I think I can answer
  the Queries of your last correspondent, <span class="sc">H.&nbsp;T.
  Ryley</span>. There can be, I think, no doubt that the familiar use of
  the name Abigail, for the <i>genus</i> "lady's maid," is derived from one
  whom I may call <i>Abigail the Great</i>; who, before she ascended King
  David's bed and throne, introduced herself under the oft-reiterated
  description of a "hand-maid." (See 1 Sam. xxv. 24, 25, 27, 28, 31.) I
  have no <i>Concordance</i> at hand, but I suspect there is no passage in
  Scripture where the word <i>hand-maid</i> is more prominent; and so the
  idea became associated with the name <i>Abigail</i>. An <i>Abigail</i>
  for a hand-maid is therefore merely analogous to a <i>Goliath</i> for a
  giant; a <i>Job</i> for a patient man; a <i>Samson</i> for a strong one;
  a <i>Jezebel</i> for a shrew, &amp;c. I need hardly add, that <span
  class="sc">H.&nbsp;T. Ryley's</span> conjecture, that this use of the term
  <i>Abigail</i> had any relation to the Lady Masham, is, therefore, quite
  supererogative&mdash;but I may go farther. The old Duchess of
  Marlborough's <i>Apology</i>, which <i>first</i> told the world that Lady
  Masham's Christian name was Abigail, and that she was a poor cousin of
  her own, was not published till 1742, when all feeling about "Abigail
  Hill and her brother Jack" was extinct. In fine, it will be found that
  the use of the term <i>Abigail</i> for a lady's maid was much more
  frequent <i>before</i> the change of Queen Anne's Whig ministry than
  <i>after</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Honorary Degrees</i> (Vol. viii, p. 8.).&mdash;Honorary degrees
  give no corporate rights. Johnson never himself assumed the title of
  Doctor; conferred on him first by the University of Dublin in 1765, and
  afterwards in 1775 by that of Oxford. See Croker's <i>Boswell</i>, p.
  168. n. 5., for the probable motives of Johnson's never having called
  himself Doctor.</p>

  <p><i>Red Hair</i> (Vol. vii., p. 616.).&mdash;The Danes are said to have

  <p>They were long the scourge of England, and to this possibly may be
  attributed in some degree the prejudice against people having hair of
  that colour.</p>

  <p>In Denmark, it is said, red-hair is esteemed a beauty.</p>

  <p>That red-haired people are fiery and passionate is undoubtedly true;
  at least I vouch for it as far as my experience goes; but that they emit
  a disagreeable odour when inattentive to personal cleanliness, is
  probably a vulgar prejudice arising from the colour of their hair,
  resembling that of the fox&mdash;<i>unde</i> the term "foxy."</p>

  Eldon's own words, after having narrated the anecdote to which C.
  refers:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In short, in all that I have had to do in future life, professional
  and judicial, I have always felt the effect of this early admonition on
  the pannels of the vehicle which conveyed me from school, 'Sat cito, si

  judge&mdash;as some have said, too deliberative; and reflection on all
  that is past will not authorise me to deny, that whilst I have been
  thinking 'Sat cito, si sat bene,' I may not sufficiently have recollected
  whether 'Sat bene, si sat cito' has had its influence."</p>

  <p><i>Council of Laodicea, Canon 35.</i> (Vol. viii., p. 7.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Clericus</span> (D.) will find <i>Angelos</i> in the text,
  without <i>Angulos</i> in the margin, in any volume which contains the
  version by Dionysius Exiguus, or that by Gentianus Hervetus; the former
  printed Mogunt. 1525; Paris, 1609, 1661, and 1687: the latter, Paris,
  1561 and 1618; and sufficiently supplied by Beverege and Howell. Both
  translations are given by Crabbe, Surius, Binius, and others.</p>

  <p>The corrupt reading <i>Angulos</i>, derived from Isidorus Mercator,
  appears in the text, and without a marginal correction, in James Merlin's
  edition of the <i>Councils</i>, Colon. 1530; in Carranza's <i>Summa</i>,
  Salmant. 1551, Lugd. 1601, Lovan. 1668 (in which last impression, the
  twelfth, the true heading of the Canon, according to Dionysius and
  Crisconius, viz. "De his qui <i>Angelos</i> colunt," is restored); and in
  the <i>Sanctiones Ecclesiasticæ</i> of Joverius, Paris, 1555.</p>

  <p>For <i>Angelos</i> in the text, with a courageous "fortè legendum"
  <i>Angulos</i> in the margin, in Pope Adrian's <i>Epitome Canonum</i>, we

  <p><i>Anna Lightfoot</i> (Vol. vii., p. 595.).&mdash;I have heard my
  mother speak of Anna Lightfoot: her family belonged to the religious
  community called Friends or Quakers. My mother was born 1751, and died in
  the year 1836. The aunt of Anna Eleanor Lightfoot was next-door-neighbour
  to my grandfather, who lived in Sir Wm. Warren's Square, Wapping. The
  family were from Yorkshire, and the father of Anna was a shoemaker, and
  kept a shop near Execution Dock, in the same district. He had a brother
  who was a linendraper, living in the neighbourhood of St. James's, at the
  west end of the town; and Anna was frequently his visitor, and here it
  was that she became acquainted with the great man of the day. She was
  missing, and advertised for by her friends; and, after some time had
  elapsed, they obtained some information as to her retreat, stating that
  she was well provided for; and her condition became known to them. She
  had a son who was a corn-merchant, but, from some circumstance, became
  deranged in his intellects, and it is said committed suicide. But whether
  she had a daughter, I never heard. A retreat was provided for Anna in one
  of those large houses surrounded with a high wall and garden, in the
  district of Cat-and-Mutton Fields, on the east side of Hackney Road,
  leading from Mile End Road; where she lived, and it is said died, but in
  what year I cannot say. All this I have heard my mother tell when I was a
  young lad; furthermore your deponent knoweth not.</p>

  <p>This passage is especially worthy of attention, as having been written
  half a century before the supposed invention of the mariner's compass by
  Flavius Gioias at Amalfi; and, as Southey <!-- Page 88 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span>remarks, "it must have
  been well known and in general use before it would thus be referred to as
  a familiar illustration."</p>

  <p>I do not think that any of your correspondents have quoted the halting
  lines with which Byron mars the pathos of the Rousseau-like letter of
  Donna Julia (<i>Don Juan</i>, canto <span class="scac">I.</span> stanza
  cxcvi.):</p>

  <p><i>Gibbon's Library</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 407. 455. 535.).&mdash;The
  following quotation from Cyrus Redding's "Recollections of the Author of
  Vathek" (<i>New Monthly Magazine</i>, vol. lxxi. p. 308.) may interest
  J.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M. and your other correspondents under this head:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'I bought it (says Beckford) to have something to read when I passed
  through Lausanne. I have not been there since. I shut myself up for six
  weeks, from early in the morning until night, only now and then taking a
  ride. The people thought me mad. I read myself nearly blind.'</p>

  <p>"I inquired if the books were rare or curious. He replied in the
  negative. There were excellent editions of the principal historical
  writers, and an extensive collection of travels. The most valuable work
  was an edition of <i>Eustathius</i>; there was also a MS. or two. All the
  books were in excellent condition; in number, considerably above six
  thousand, near seven perhaps. He should have read himself mad if there
  had been novelty enough, and he had stayed much longer.</p>

  <p>"'I broke away, and dashed among the mountains. There is excellent
  reading there, too, equally to my taste. Did you ever travel alone among
  mountains?'</p>

  <p>"I replied that I had, and been fully sensible of their mighty
  impressions. 'Do you retain Gibbon's library?'</p>

  <p>"'It is now dispersed, I believe. I made it a present to my excellent

  <p><i>St. Paul's Epistles to Seneca</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 500.
  583.).&mdash;The affirmation so frequently made and alluded to by
  J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;S. of Hull, that Seneca became, in the last year of his life, a
  convert to Christianity, is an old tradition, which has just been revived
  by a French author, M. Amédée Fleury, and is discussed and attempted to
  be established by him at great length in two octavo volumes. I have not
  read the book, but a learned reviewer of it, M. S. De Sacy, shows, with
  the greatest appearance of reason and authority, that the tradition,
  instead of being strengthened, is weakened by all that M. Fleury has said
  about it. M. De Sacy's review is contained in the <i>Journal des
  Débats</i> of June 30, in which excellent paper he is a frequent and
  delightful writer on literary subjects. In the hope that it may interest
  and gratify J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;S. to be informed of M. Fleury's new work, I send this
  scrap of information to the "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p><i>"Hip, Hip, Hurrah!"</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 595. 633).&mdash;The reply
  suggested by your correspondent R.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;F., that the above exclamation
  originated in the Crusades, and is a corruption of the initial letters of
  "Hierosolyma est perdita," never appeared to me to be very apposite.</p>

  <p>In <i>A Collection of National English Ballads</i>, edited and
  published by W. Chapple, 1838, in a description of the song "Old Simon,
  the King," the favourite of Squire Western in <i>Tom Jones</i>, the
  following lines are quoted:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"'Hang up all the poor hep drinkers,'</p>
      <p>Cries old Sim, the king of skinkers."<a name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A note to the above states, in reference to the word "hep," that it
  was a term of derision, applied to those who drank a weak infusion of the
  "hep" (hip) berry, or sloe. "Hence," says the writer, "the exclamation of
  'Hip, hip, hurrah,' corrupted from 'Hip, hip, away.'" The couplet quoted
  above was written up in the Apollo Room at the Devil Tavern, Temple Bar,
  where Ben Jonson's club, the "Apollo Club," used to meet. Many a drinker
  of modern Port has equally good reason to exclaim with his brethren of
  old, "Hip, hip, away!"</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Brent</span>.</p>

<div class="note">

  <p>A <i>skinker</i> is one who serves drink.</p>

</div>
  <p><i>Emblemata</i> (Vol. vii., p. 614.).&mdash;I have a small edition of
  the <i>Emblemata Horatiana</i>, with the following title-page:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Othonis VænI Emblemata Horatiana Imaginibus in <i>æs</i> incisis
  atque Latino, Germanico, Gallico et Belgico carmine Illustrata:
  Amstelædami, apud Henricum Wetstenium, <span class="scac">M. DC.
  LXXXIV.</span>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The engravings, of which there are 103, measure about four inches by
  three; the book contains 207 pages, exclusive of the index. "Amicitiæ
  Trutina," mentioned by <span class="sc">Mr. Weld Taylor</span>, is the
  sixty-sixth plate on page 133.</p>

  <p>There is another volume of Emblems by Otho Venius, of which I have a
  copy:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Amorum Emblemata Figuris Æneis Incisa, studio Othonis VænI: Batavo
  Lugdunensis Antverpiæe Venalia apud Auctorem prostant apud Hieronymum
  Verdussen, <span class="scac">MDCIIX</span>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The engravings, of which (besides an allegorical frontispiece
  representing the power of Venus) there are 124, are oval, measuring five
  inches in length by three and a half inches in height. The designs appear
  to me to be very good. On the <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page89"></a>{89}</span>first plate is the name of the engraver, "C.
  Boel fecit." Each engraving has a motto, with verses in Latin, Italian,
  and French. Recommendatory verses, by Hugo Grotius, Daniel Heinsius, Max.
  Vrientius, Ph. Rubentius, and Petro Benedetti, are prefixed. It appears
  from Rose's <i>Biographical Dictionary</i> (article "Van Veen"), that
  Venius published another illustrated work, <i>The Seven Twin Sons of
  Lara</i>. Is this work known?</p>

  <p>Horace Walpole did not appreciate Venius. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The perplexed and silly emblems of Venius are well
  known."&mdash;<i>Anecdotes of Painting</i>, vol. ii. p. 167.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Emblems of Gabriele Rollenhagius (of which I have also a copy)
  consist of two centuries. The engravings are circular, with a motto round
  each, and Latin verses at foot. My edition was published at Utrecht,
  <span class="scac">MDCXIII</span>.</p>

  <p>I write rather in the hope of eliciting information, than of
  attempting to give any, on a subject which appears to me to deserve
  farther inquiry.</p>

  <p><i>Campvere, Privileges of</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 262. 440.).&mdash;Will
  your contributors J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;S. and J.&nbsp;L. oblige me with references to the
  works in which these privileges are mentioned?</p>

  <p>They will find them noticed also at pages 67. and 68. of the second
  volume of L. Guicciardini's <i>Belgium</i> (ed. 1646): "<i>Jus Gruis
  liberæ.</i>" This is mentioned as one of the privileges of Campvere. Can
  any of your legal friends tell me what this is, and where I may find it
  treated of?</p>

  <p><i>Slang Expressions: "Just the Cheese"</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  617.).&mdash;This phrase is only some ten or twelve years old. Its origin
  was this:&mdash;Some desperate witty fellows, by way of giving a comic
  turn to the phrase "C'est une autre chose," used to translate it, "That
  is another cheese;" and after awhile these words became "household
  words," and when anything positive or specific was intended to be pointed
  out, "That's the cheese" became adopted, which is nearly synonymous with
  "Just the cheese."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Astolpho.</span></p>

  <p><i>The Honorable Miss E. St. Leger</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  598.).&mdash;Perhaps your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Breen</span>
  may like to be informed that the late General the Honorable Arthur St.
  Leger related to me the account of his relative having been made a master
  mason, and that she had secreted herself in an old clock-case in
  Doneraile House, on purpose to learn the secrets of the lodge, but was
  discovered from having coughed. The Rev. Richard Arthur St. Leger, of
  Starcross, Devon, has an engraving of the lady, who is represented
  arrayed in all the costume of a master mason, with the apron, ring, and
  jewel of the order.</p>

  <p><i>Queries from the Navorscher</i> (Vol. vii., p. 595.)&mdash;"The
  Choice of Hercules," in the <i>Tatler</i>, was written by Addison; Swift
  did not contribute more than one article to that publication, a treatise
  on "Improprieties of Language." The allegory of "Religion being the
  Foundation of Contentment" in the <i>Adventurer</i>, was the work of
  Hawkesworth, to whose pen most of those papers are attributable.</p>

  <p>"<i>Amentium haud amantium.</i>"&mdash;The alliteration of this
  passage in the <i>Andria</i> of Terence is somewhat difficult to preserve
  in English; perhaps to render it</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"An act of <i>frenzy</i> rather than <i>friendship</i>,"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>would keep up the pun, though a weak translation, bringing to mind the
  words of the song:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O call it by some other name,</p>
      <p>For <i>friendship</i> is too cold."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In French the expression might be turned "follement plutôt que
  folâtrement," although this is a fault on the other side, and a stronger
  word than the original.</p>

  <p class="author">T. O. M.</p>

  <p>"<i>Pity is akin to love</i>" (Vol. i., p. 248.).&mdash;Though a long
  time has elapsed since the birthplace of these words was queried, no
  answer has, I think, appeared in your columns. Will you then allow me to
  refer H. to Southern's <i>Oroonoko</i>, Act II. Sc. 1.?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Blandford.</i> Alas! I pity you.</p>

    <div class="stanza">

      <p><i>Pity's akin to love</i>, and every thought</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Our library table is covered at this time with books for all classes
  of readers. The theological student will peruse with no ordinary interest
  the learned <i>Dissertation on the Origin and Connexion of the Gospels,
  with a Synopsis of the Parallel Passages in the Original and Authorised
  Version, and Critical Notes</i>, by James Smith, Esq., of Jordan Hill:
  and when he has mastered the arguments contained in it, he may turn to
  the new number of <i>The Journal of Sacred Literature</i>, in which will
  be found a great variety of able papers. Our antiquarian friends will be
  gratified with a volume compiled in a great measure from original family
  papers, by its author Mr. Bankes, the Member for Dorsetshire; and which
  narrates <i>The Story of Corfe Castle, and of many who have lived there,
  collected from Ancient Chronicles and Records; also from the Private
  Memoirs of a Family resident there in the Time of the Civil Wars</i>. The
  volume, which is with good feeling inscribed by the author to his friends
  and neighbours, Members of the Society for Mutual Improvement in the
  borough of Corfe Castle, contains many interesting <!-- Page 90 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>{90}</span>notices of his ancestors,
  the well-known judge, Sir John Bankes and his lady&mdash;so memorable for
  her gallant defence of Corfe Castle&mdash;drawn from the family papers.
  <i>The Royal Descent of Nelson and Wellington from Edward I., King of
  England, with Tables of Pedigree and Genealogical Memoirs</i>, compiled
  by G.&nbsp;R. French, is a handsomely printed volume, which will please the
  genealogist; while the historical student will be more interested in
  <i>The Flowers of History, especially such as relate to the Affairs of
  Britain from the Beginning of the World to the Year 1307, collected by
  Matthew of Westminster, translated by C.&nbsp;D. Yonge</i>, Vol. I., a new
  volume of Bohn's <i>Antiquarian Library</i>, and an important addition to
  his series of translations of our early national chronicles. The
  classical student is indebted to the same publisher for the second volume
  of Mr. Owen's <i>Translation of the Organon, or Logical Treatises of
  Aristotle</i>: nor will he regard as the least important addition to his
  library, the new Part (No. VII.) of Smith's <i>Dictionary of Greek and
  Roman Geography</i>, which extends from <i>Cyrrhus</i> to <i>Etruria</i>,
  and is distinguished by the same excellences as the preceding Parts. We
  must conclude these Notes with a brief reference to a handsome reprint of
  the great work of De Quincy, the appearance of which in the <i>London
  Magazine</i> some thirty years since created so great a sensation, we
  mean of course his <i>Confessions of an English Opium-eater</i>.</p>

  <p>* <span class="sc">Example.</span>&mdash;At the commencement of the
  year 1841, a person aged thirty took out a Policy for 1000<i>l.</i>, the
  annual payment for which is 24<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in 1847 he
  had paid in premiums 168<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but the profits
  being 2¼ per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> per annum for each 1000<i>l.</i>) he had 157<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> added to the Policy, almost as much as the premiums paid.</p>

  <p>The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
  one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,
  nourishing, and restorative remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
  kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of body,
  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and
  hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with the most
  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the
  troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth to express the
  conviction that Du Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the cure of
  incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>
